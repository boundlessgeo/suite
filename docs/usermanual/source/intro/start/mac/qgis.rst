QGIS
====

This section will describe how to install QGIS on Mac OS X.

Unlike all of the other components of OpenGeo Suite which can be installed from a single installer package, QGIS is broken out into its own package and must be installed separately.

Prerequisites
-------------

QGIS can run on any recent hardware/software combination.

Install
-------

#. Extract the provided archive. There will be a single entry: :file:`QGIS.app`.

   .. figure:: img/qgis-app.png

      QGIS.app

#. Drag this icon into the :guilabel:`Applications` folder.

   .. figure:: img/qgis-install.png

      QGIS copied to Applications folder

QGIS is now installed, and can be run like any normal application.

Uninstall
---------

To uninstall QGIS, delete the icon from the :guilabel:`Applications` folder.
