OpenGeo Suite for Windows
=========================

This document describes how to manage installaton of OpenGeo Suite for Windows. 

OpenGeo Suite for Windows consists of two installer packages. One installer contains everything except for QGIS, which is broken out into a separate installer. These installer packages can be installed separately or together.

The primary OpenGeo Suite installer has the most components, so the bulk of this section will be devoted to it.
