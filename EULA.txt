Definitions. Terms used below with initial capital letters shall, unless otherwise defined herein, have the respective meanings set forth at the end of this Agreement (see Section 15).

1. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Boundless grants to Customer, during the Term, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to install the Software on equipment owned or controlled, and operated by Customer, have the Software installed for Customer’s benefit and access in a third party computing environment (e.g., AWS, Azure and the like),, and to use up to that number of copies (operational instances) of the Software in a production environment that is set forth in the applicable Order Form. Customer may also install and have installed (as those terms are used above), and use one (1) copy (operational instance) of the Software in a non-production environment and one (1) copy (operational instance) of the Software for backup/failover purposes, such backup copy to be used only if the production copy of the Software is lost, corrupted, destroyed or otherwise unavailable, in which case Customer may make one (1) additional copy to replace the backup copy. Customer’s aforementioned rights to install, have installed, access and use the Software terminates upon the expiration or termination of the Term.

2. Restrictions. Customer shall not itself, or through any parent, subsidiary, Affiliate, agent or other third party:

2.1. sell, lease, license, distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer in whole or in part, any Software or the Documentation to a third party; or

2.2. decompile, disassemble, translate, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Software, in whole or in part, nor shall Customer use any mechanical, electronic or other method to trace, decompile, disassemble, or identify the source code of the Software or encourage others to do so, except to the limited extent, if any, that applicable Law permits such acts notwithstanding any contractual prohibitions, provided, however, before Customer exercises any rights that Customer believes to be entitled to based on mandatory Law, Customer shall provide Boundless with thirty (30) days prior written notice and provide all reasonably requested information to allow Boundless to assess Customer’s claim and, at Boundless’ sole discretion, to provide alternatives that reduce any adverse impact on Boundless’ intellectual property or other rights; or

2.3. create, develop, license, install, use, or deploy any third party software or services to circumvent or provide access, permissions or rights which violate this Agreement; or

2.4. modify or create derivative works based upon the Software or Documentation; or

2.5. disclose the results of any benchmark test of the Software to any third party without Boundless’ prior written approval; or

2.6. change any proprietary rights notices which appear in the Software or Documentation.

3. Third Party Vendor Products. Boundless or third parties may from time to time make available to Customers (e.g., through Boundless Connect or direct agreement) third-party products or services, including but not limited to add-ons and plugins as well as implementation, customization, training, and other consulting services. All such third party products or services are subject to separate agreements (and exchange of data) solely between Customers and the third party vendor. Boundless does not warrant or support non-Boundless products or services, whether or not they are designated by Boundless as “verified” or otherwise, and disclaims all liability for such products or services. If Customer install or enable any third party products or services for use with Boundless products, Customer acknowledge that the vendors of those products and services may have access Customer Data (as defined below) as required for the interoperation and support of such add-ons with the Boundless products. Boundless shall not be responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data resulting from any such access by third party add-on vendors.

4. Open Source Software. The Software and Upgrades may include individual open source software components, each of which has its own copyright and its own applicable license conditions and Customer hereby consents to such applicable license conditions. These open source software components are licensed under the terms of the applicable open source license conditions and/or copyright notices that can be found in the licenses file, the Documentation or other materials accompanying the Software and Upgrades.

5. Technical Support. Boundless shall provide Technical Support for the Software as set forth in the Order Form and described in the Support Terms document located on the Boundless support portal (see https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/docs/support/SupportTerms.html). Technical Support is provided to Subscription Customers solely for their internal use. Customer shall designate the Support Contacts who are responsible for resolving user issues, and only such Support Contacts may contact Boundless for the provision of Technical Support. Technical Support does not include anything not set forth in the Support Terms, and specifically excludes support of any hardware or any software other than Boundless Software, including without limitation, any integration with Third Party Software.

Remote Diagnostics
In order for the Software problem to be quickly analyzed, Boundless technicians must have reasonable access to the Customer network infrastructure in which the Software resides as outlined in this Agreement. Boundless shall have no liability to Customer if Boundless’ ability to render support is impaired by Customer inability to provide telecommunications functionality required for remote support.

6. Software Upgrades. From time to time during the Term, Boundless may provide Upgrades of its Software. Upgrades may incorporate third party upgrades as well as accumulated bug fixes. There shall be no additional charge for Upgrades provided Customer is current in the Fees (as defined below) as set forth in the applicable Order Form. Customer shall implement provided Upgrades as soon as is reasonably feasible. Upgrades do not include new Software. New Software provides significant new features and functions not available in the current Software line, ports existing Software to new hardware or software platforms or provides significant new functionality on new hardware or software platforms. Boundless Technical Support shall only be provided for: (a) the most current Minor/Major Release of the Software; (b) any Extensions to that Minor/Major Release; and (c) the two (2) immediately preceding Minor/Major Releases of that Software.

7. Fees and Payment. Customer agrees to pay Boundless the fees (“Fees”) as stated in the applicable Order Form. In addition, Customer shall pay all sales, use, value added, withholding, excise taxes and other tax, duty, custom and similar fees levied upon the delivery or use of the Subscriptions described in this Agreement. Fees shall be invoiced in full upon the effective date of the applicable Order Form. Unless otherwise provided on the applicable Order Form, all invoices shall be paid in US dollars and are due upon receipt and shall be paid within thirty (30) days. Payments are non-refundable and shall be made without right of set-off or chargeback. Any payments by Customer that are not paid on or before the date such payments are due under this Agreement shall bear interest at the greater of (a) two percent (2%) per month and (b) the maximum rate allowed by law. Interest shall accrue beginning on the first day following the due date for payment and shall be compounded quarterly. Payment of such interest by Customer shall not limit, in any way, Boundless’ right to exercise any other remedies Boundless may have as a consequence of the lateness of any payment. If Customer fails to pay Fees in accordance with this Section, Boundless may, at its option, terminate or suspend fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement until such payment is received by Boundless. If any applicable Law requires Customer to withhold amounts from any payments to Boundless under this Agreement, Customer shall effect such withholding, remit such amounts to the appropriate taxing authorities and promptly furnish Boundless with tax receipts evidencing the payments of such amounts.

8. Confidentiality. Boundless and Customer as a Receiving Party shall (a) hold the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in trust and confidence and avoid the disclosure or release thereof to any other person or entity by using the same degree of care as it uses to avoid unauthorized use, disclosure, or dissemination of its own Confidential Information of a similar nature, but not less than reasonable care, and (b) not use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose whatsoever except as expressly contemplated under this Agreement. A Receiving Party shall disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only to those of Receiving Party’s employees and contractors having a need to know such Confidential Information and shall be responsible for all violations of this Section 8 by such employees and contractors. A Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as required to comply with binding orders of governmental entities that have jurisdiction over it; provided that the Receiving Party, if legally permissible, gives the Disclosing Party reasonable written notice to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, discloses only such Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as is required by the governmental entity, and uses commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party disclosed. Notwithstanding the above, Customer agrees that Boundless, its employees and agents shall be free to use and employ their general skills, know-how, and expertise, and to use, disclose, and employ any generalized ideas, concepts, know-how, methods, techniques or skills gained or learned during the course of any Subscriptions or Technical Support performed under or in connection with this Agreement.

9. Ownership.

9.1. Ownership of Software. Boundless and its licensors shall retain all intellectual property and proprietary rights in and to the Software, Upgrades, Documentation, and related works, including but not limited to any derivative work of the foregoing. Boundless and/or its agents shall be deemed the author and/or owner of all other designs, concepts, graphics, logos, processes, features, ideas, and other creative work, developed by Boundless in the process of fulfilling this Agreement that do not infringe on Customer’s trademarked designs, logos, and look and feel. Any modifications, improvement or alterations to the Software owned by Boundless, whether authorized or not, made by Customer or any third party shall be the sole and exclusive property of Boundless, and Customer hereby assigns all of its right, title and interest in and to such modifications, improvements or alterations to Boundless.

9.2. Customer Materials. This Agreement shall have no effect on any intellectual property rights, equipment, software, documents, materials, or other items owned by Customer before entering this Agreement.

9.3. Customer Data. Customer grants to Boundless a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use Customer Data provided or made available by Customer to Boundless during the Term solely for the purpose of performing the Technical Support or other services requested by Customer. Any Customer Confidential Information contained within Customer’s Data will be subject to the terms outlined in Section 9 of this Agreement. “Customer Data” means any data, content, code, video, images or other materials of any type that Customer upload, submit or otherwise transmit to or through Boundless. Customer retains all right, title and interest in and to Customer Data in the form provided to Boundless. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer grants Boundless a worldwide, non-exclusive right to collect, use, reproduce, distribute, store, and share Customer Data with third parties (a) in connection with Boundless’ delivery of services to Customer; (b) to ensure Customer has complied and is complying with Customer’s obligations under this Agreement, and as otherwise permitted by Customer (such permission not to be unreasonably withheld) on request from Boundless from time to time. Boundless will own all right, title and interest in all information it collects with respect to Customer’s use of the Software, including without limitation, statistical information and traffic analysis data (“Usage Data”). Boundless may use and exploit all Usage Data for any purpose without any obligation to Customer; provided however, that Boundless may only disclose Usage Data to third parties so long as the Usage Data is disclosed only in the aggregate and not in a manner so that it is attributable to Customer or any individual.

10. Responsibility for Customer Data.

10.1. General. Customer must ensure that use of Customer Data is at all times compliant with all applicable local, state, federal and international laws and regulations (“Laws”). Customer represents and warrant that: (i) Customer has obtained all necessary rights, releases and permissions to provide all Customer Data to Boundless and to grant the rights granted to Boundless in this Agreement and (ii) Customer Data and its transfer to and use by Boundless as authorized by Customer under this Agreement does not violate any Laws (including without limitation those relating to export control and electronic communications) or rights of any third party, including without limitation any intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, or rights of publicity, and any use, collection and disclosure authorized herein is not inconsistent with the terms of any applicable privacy policies. Boundless assumes no responsibility or liability for Customer Data, and Customer shall be solely responsible for the Customer Data and the consequences of using, disclosing, storing, or transmitting it.

10.2. Indemnity for Customer Data. Customer will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Boundless from and against any loss, cost, liability or damage, including attorneys’ fees, for which Boundless becomes liable arising from or relating to any claim relating to Customer Data, including but not limited to any claim brought by a third party alleging that Customer infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third party or violates applicable Law. This indemnification obligation is subject to Customer receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Customer to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Boundless at Customer’s expense.

Boundless shall, at its own expense and as its sole obligation and Customer’s exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty, use commercially reasonable efforts to fix or replace, at its option, any defective Software which Boundless has determined to be under warranty after receipt of written notice as to such warranty claim from Customer within the Software Warranty Period or, if Boundless determines that it is unable to correct a material defect, Customer may terminate this Agreement, return the affected Software and Documentation and receive a refund of the license fees paid for the affected Software. Any defect correction provided to Customer will not extend the original Software Warranty Period.

Boundless may make changes to terms located at a URL referenced in this Agreement, including these terms (collectively, the “URL Terms”) from time to time. Boundless will post the amended terms and will update the “Last Updated Date” at the top. By continuing to access or use the Software after Boundless has provided Customer with such notice of a change, Customer is indicating that it agrees to be bound by the modified terms. If the change has a material adverse impact on Customer and Customer does not agree to the change, Customer must notify Boundless within 30 days of the applicable Last Updated Date. If Customer notifies Boundless as required, then Customer will remain governed by the terms in effect immediately prior to the change until the end of the then-current Subscription Period (or, in the case of Services, the completion of the applicable Services).
